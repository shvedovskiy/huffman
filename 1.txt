The idea behind Huffman coding is based upon the frequency of a symbol in a sequence. The symbol that is the most frequent in that sequence gets a new code that is very small, the least frequent symbol will get a code that is very long, so that when we’ll translate the input we want to encode the most frequent symbols will take less space than they used to and the least frequent symbols will take more space but because they’re less frequent it won’t matter that much. For this application I chose the symbol to be 8 bits long so that the symbol will be a character (char).
